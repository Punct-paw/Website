/* mediaqueries.css
   Responsive adjustments for different screen widths. Each media query block explains the breakpoint and changes made.
   Breakpoints are chosen based on common device sizes: 1400px (large tablets/laptops), 1200px (tablets), 600px (phones).
   The goal is to maintain the split-screen below the intro on all screens, but stack if necessary on very small devices for usability.
   Comments added for clarity on why each adjustment is made.
